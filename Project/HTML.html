        <div>Attack on Titan</div>
        <div>
          humanity's desperate fight for survival against giant, man-eating
          humanoids called Titans, focusing on young Eren Yeager, Mikasa
          Ackerman, and Armin Arlert, whose peaceful lives are shattered when a
          Colossal Titan breaches their wall, leading them to join the elite
          soldiers (Survey Corps) to fight back, uncover the Titans' origins,
